## 1. Introduction: Natural Expectations vs. Realistic Responsibilities

When anyone assumes a leadership position, they naturally desire to prove their competence. Having ascended to the role as a result of long-term dedication and exceptional performance, it is human nature to view the position as a legitimate *reward* for past efforts. We all seek validation and wish to confirm our indispensability to the organization.

However, from the perspective of organizational management, a subtle but critical tension exists between these personal expectations and the role the organization demands. The ultimate reason an organization appoints a leader is not to reward an individual, but out of a **Functional Necessity** to entrust authority and resources to a specific person to achieve the common goals of survival and success.

This essay affirms the natural human desire for recognition while discussing how it must be harmonized with the **Fiduciary Duty** of achieving organizational goals. Specifically, it analyzes the psychological traps leaders often fall into and proposes **Servant Leadership** not merely as a moral imperative, but as a wise **management strategy** to overcome these pitfalls and generate superior results.

## 2. The First Principle of Leadership: From Excellent Player to Great Coach

The organization requires a leader to transition from possessing the 'Ability' of an excellent individual contributor to demonstrating the managerial 'Capability' to achieve the goals of a unit. As Peter Drucker defined management as "**Management by Objectives (MBO),**" a leader is an entity that produces results by optimally allocating limited resources.

Many leaders struggle to prove the excellence they possessed as practitioners. This stems from a healthy sense of pride in not wanting to lose their competence. However, as implied by Laurence J. Peter's 'Peter Principle,' execution ability and leadership capability are distinct dimensions.

Therefore, a leader's growth begins by shifting the question from "How well do I perform?" to "How well do I enable my team to perform?" This is not an abandonment of personal brilliance, but an evolution into a coach who creates a greater brilliance through the team.

## 3. Three Psychological Dilemmas and Their Sublimation

In practicing leadership, anyone can fall prey to personal emotions, the desire for recognition, and the temptation of comfort. This is not because the leader is deficient, but because the leader is also a human being with emotions. The key lies in how these dilemmas are managed and sublimated.

### 3.1. Managing Emotions: Bearing the Weight of Relationships

As a human being, a leader finds it painful to work with those they do not get along with or with whom they have past grievances. It is human nature to want to avoid collaboration with certain department heads or to care more for subordinates who follow well than for those who have caused trouble.

**The Cost of the Dilemma:** However, if a leader avoids collaboration to resolve personal discomfort, the cost is transferred directly to the organization as '**Transaction Costs.**' Practitioners end up wasting energy navigating the leader's emotional landscape.

**Sublimation:** True leadership is not about suppressing emotions, but surpassing personal feelings with the professional will that "organizational goals are more important than my emotions." Smiling, shaking hands, and strategically collaborating with someone you dislike—that is the highest form of professionalism a leader can demonstrate.

### 3.2. The Paradox of Presence: The Trap of the 'Super Leader'

Leaders with a strong sense of responsibility often obsess over the idea that "I must solve this." Intervening directly when subordinates show deficiencies and feeling relieved by one's own competence may seem 'heroic' at first glance.

**The Cost of the Dilemma:** However, when a leader attempts to manage every detail (micromanagement) and claim all the credit, the organization's growth becomes ironically trapped by the leader's own 'Ceiling.' Members become passive entities watching the leader's mouth, and collective intelligence is paralyzed.

**Sublimation:** When a leader decides not to be the hero but to be the 'Kingmaker' who creates heroes, the organization experiences explosive growth. Creating a stage where members can shine, rather than one where I shine—this is a higher dimension of achievement.

### 3.3. Expanding Trust: Impartiality Beyond Familiarity

It is natural to want to entrust important tasks to employees who have worked with you for a long time and understand your intentions well. This is also a choice for speed and stability.

**The Cost of the Dilemma:** However, if this solidifies into 'Favoritism,' it sends a signal to the organization that "relationships are more important than performance." This disenfranchises the silent majority of talented individuals and, in the long run, invites 'Gresham's Law,' where bad money drives out good.

**Sublimation:** A leader's trust must be based on 'current competence,' not 'past connections.' The 'uncomfortable courage' to boldly employ capable people, even if they are strangers or offer bitter advice, maintains the organization's vitality.

### 4. Structural Shift: From Control to Support, Introducing Servant Leadership

It is difficult to overcome these human dilemmas—emotional exhaustion, hero complex, temptation of favoritism—solely through individual willpower every time. Solving this requires a new framework that fundamentally redefines how leadership operates: '**Servant Leadership,**' championed by Robert K. Greenleaf.

Servant Leadership is literally a leadership style where the leader prioritizes '**Serving**' the members. It is a philosophy that a leader should not reign as a master but become a 'Facilitator' who removes obstacles and helps members grow so they can unleash their potential. It shifts the role from 'Controller' to 'Supporter.'

Crucially, **this is not merely a moral admonition to "be a nice person."** Rather, **it emerges as a powerful management strategy that structurally blocks the psychological traps mentioned above and maximizes organizational efficiency.** When a leader lays down their Ego and serves the members, the organization's energy flows not toward internal politics (watching the leader), but toward external customers and goal achievement. This converts leadership energy from centripetal force (toward me) to centrifugal force (toward the goal).

## 5. Servant Leadership as Strategy: The Most Selfish Altruism

### 5.1. Rational Doubt: "Isn't this too inefficient?"

Some may ask, "In the fierce business jungle, isn't serving and waiting for members too idealistic and inefficient?" This question is valid. The primary goals of a business are survival and profit generation, and time is money.

Indeed, Servant Leadership 'appears' highly inefficient in the short term. It may seem wasteful to spend three hours coaching a member to solve a problem themselves when the leader could solve it in one hour by directing it personally. However, understanding how this time, wearing the 'mask of inefficiency,' transforms into greater actual efficiency is key. We will examine this through three specific cases.

### 5.2. Efficiency Disguised as Inefficiency: Case Analysis

#### [Case 1] Handling Mistakes: Psychological Safety via Shielding
When a team member makes a critical mistake, an efficiency-minded leader might immediately reprimand them and demand a written promise to prevent recurrence. This seems like the fastest way to enforce discipline. In contrast, a Servant Leader acts as a 'shield' protecting the member from external blame and spends internal time analyzing the cause instead of blaming.

**Short-term View:** It looks foolish; the leader takes the heat, and problem-solving takes longer.

**Long-term Efficiency:** This process builds 'Psychological Safety'. Members trust that "if I report a mistake, we can solve it," leading to immediate sharing rather than hiding problems. Consequently, the organization saves costs by detecting issues early, and members propose innovative ideas without fear. Trust gained through protection guarantees much faster problem-solving speeds than silence gained through reprimand.

#### [Case 2] The Paradox of Delegation: Investing in Scalability
Facing complex and critical tasks, a capable leader is tempted to think, "It's faster if I do it myself than explaining it." A Servant Leader, however, endures the frustration, delegates the task, and supports the trial-and-error process through coaching.

**Short-term View:** Obvious inefficiency with lower quality and longer time. The leader might even have to work overtime to fix things.

**Long-term Efficiency:** If the leader handles execution personally, the organization's total output is forever trapped within 'one leader's time.' By patiently cultivating members, the leader can eventually step back from execution to focus on strategic decisions. Six months later, the organization transforms from one where the leader runs alone to one where five leader-level members run together. The current frustration is an essential 'Opportunity Cost' for scaling up productivity exponentially.

#### [Case 3] The Paradox of Knowledge Work: Uncontrollable Immersion
Consider an environment like semiconductor or AI development, where work is highly specialized and involves highly educated talent. The performance of these knowledge workers comes not from 'time input' but from 'depth of immersion.'

**Limits of Control:** If a leader pressures them authoritatively or disappoints them with personal emotions, they may outwardly follow instructions without issue. However, beneath the surface, they may engage in '**Quiet Quitting,**' becoming uncooperative or prioritizing only their own interests. There is a massive performance gap compared to when they are fully immersed, but it is impossible for a leader to micro-manage this subtle psychological disengagement. Attempting to do so drains management resources.

**Strategic Necessity:** Therefore, in such high-level professional organizations, Servant Leadership is not about kindness but is closer to the only workable management method. Only when a leader lowers themselves and genuinely respects members can they elicit '**voluntary immersion**' from within the uncontrollable minds of the staff.

### 5.3. Calculated Patience

Ultimately, the 'Service' and 'Patience' in Servant Leadership are not unconditional acts of charity. They are sophisticated investment activities that input current time to secure explosive future productivity.

The temptation for a leader to think "It's faster if I do it" is a trap that provides 'short-term relief' while eroding the organization's future. Conversely, choosing to endure immediate inefficiency to grow members is a 'Strategic Belief' and 'Professional Attitude' where the leader controls their instincts to choose the best action for the organization's goals.

## 6. Conclusion: The 'Warm Strategist' Dedicated to Goals

Leadership is not a glittering crown, but often a lonely and heavy cross. A leader must constantly fight against the springing desire for recognition, the temptation of comfort, and the instinct for immediate efficiency. This battle is never easy, and sometimes one might feel foolish.

However, the greatest leaders are those who do not deny these human instincts but sublimate them into energy for the organization. They are people who cooperate beyond grievances, set members up as heroes beyond their own desire to shine, and wait for the organization's long-term capability beyond immediate speed.

Like the 'Level 5 Leader' described by Jim Collins, possessing Professional Will (fierce resolve for results) while choosing Personal Humility (the attitude of serving) to achieve those goals—this is the most mature and beautiful state a leader can reach, and the ultimate strategy to lead an organization to victory.
